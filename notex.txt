Key Terms
    Linear search
    Binary search
    Divide and conquer
    Depth-first search (DFS)
    Breadth-first search (BFS)
    In-order search
    Pre-ordering
    Post-ordering

Linear Search:
    -arr.indexOf(someValue) 
        -implemented by taking a look at all values

Binary Search:
    -works only on sorted arrays
    -take look at middle and see if you are bigger or smaller.
    -discard the bad array
    -repeat step with good array.
    -logarithmic time complexity
    -sometimes called divide and conquer approach.

Searching and Traversal in a tree:
    1. Depth of first search (DFS)
        -start at node.
        -go as far down as you can (all nodes have been visited)
        -when you reach bottom something with no node 
        -backtracking
    2. Breadth of first search (BFS)
        -works across the rows of a tree.
        -top row handled first, then 2nd ...
        -"First-in-first-out approach"
        -store siblings in the queue and process them in order.
        -Visit a node add it to queue. 
        -Remove the node from the queue
        -Then visit the children which we again will add to the queue

    *Ordering:
        -in-order traversal search 
            -when we searched left first then handle the node then traverse right.
        -pre-order traversal  
            -handle node then handle branches.
        -post-order traversal  
            -handle branches then handle node
        **each method of ordering will give you a different order of values
